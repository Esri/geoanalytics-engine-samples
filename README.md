# geoanalytics-engine-samples

Here are a set of PySpark notebook samples using [ArcGIS GeoAnalytics Engine](https://developers.arcgis.com/geoanalytics/).

## Contents
* **notebooks** - Workflows and tutorials contained in PySpark notebooks that can be run in any Spark environment where 
  GeoAnalytics Engine is installed.
* **scripts** - Installation scripts and other non-notebook examples.

## Instructions

1. Fork and then clone the repo. 
2. Open a notebook in a [local PySpark session](https://developers.arcgis.com/geoanalytics/install/local_mode/) or 
   upload to [Databricks](https://developers.arcgis.com/geoanalytics/install/databricks/), 
   [Amazon EMR](https://developers.arcgis.com/geoanalytics/install/aws_emr/), 
   [Google Cloud Dataproc](https://developers.arcgis.com/geoanalytics/install/google_dp/), or 
   [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://developers.arcgis.com/geoanalytics/install/azure_syn/).
3. [Authorize](https://developers.arcgis.com/geoanalytics/install/authorization/) GeoAnalytics Engine and stage any 
   example data if required before running the notebook.

## Requirements

* A running Spark cluster or local session with GeoAnalytics Engine installed. For more information see 
  [Install and set up](https://developers.arcgis.com/geoanalytics/install/).
* An active GeoAnalytics Engine [subscription](https://developers.arcgis.com/geoanalytics/reference/licensing/).
* For notebooks that use [feature service](https://developers.arcgis.com/geoanalytics/data/data-sources/feature-service/) 
  data, an internet connection is required.
